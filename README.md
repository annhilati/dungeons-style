## Abstract
This pack takes a lot of textures found in and known from Minecraft Dungeons, adapts them and embeds them into Minecraft with respect to logic and focus on making world generation more beautiful.

## About Biomes
Every biome features some unique textures. Many biomes have a special grass texture and some trees and their leaves are changed

## The Feature of this pack
Features get added mostly biome-wise.
Since there are a lot of textures I can use there is much room for improvement. And improvement will be there. Everything that doesn't look exactly right will be fixed soon or later!
